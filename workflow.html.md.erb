This page is optional. If the workflow for using this product is complicated, then consider adding a workflow page here. 

Use a flowchart or a numbered list to show in what order users need to carry out various tasks described in this doc and elsewhere. 

If the workflow is straightforward, (Install —> Configure —> Deploy -> Use —> Maintain) and matches the order of topics in the subnav, 
then you most likely can omit this page.
